# What am I up to now?

Currently following the Computer Security track at VU Amsterdam where I'm learning a lot about how systems work from the ground up. Learning by breaking things has been a very valuable experience so far. I'm also working on an engineering project where we design and build small (toy) cars that will be able to compete in the autonomous driving competition, the NXP Cup. Frustration with the hardware from previous years motivated us to make it better for students at the VU once and for all. In addition to building the cars, we'll be working on a basic software architecture that will allow 15 bachelor students to research a complex software/hardware component that they add ontop to the car. They can choose to do this for their final bachelor project so we will be offering guidance there as well.  


  


I'm trying to program in Rust as much as I can so that I can do research on the [Rust Compiler](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust) and to hopefully contribute to the amazing work done by Xavier Denis on using [Deductive Verification on Rust code](https://github.com/xldenis/creusot). And since it's 2023, there is Natural Language ML project idea I might be working on as well.
