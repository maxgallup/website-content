# Max Gallup
I'm a computer science student interested in free and open source software, the Rust programming language, WebAssembly,  blockchains, machine learning and operating systems. I would love to learn more about how to prevent security vulnerabilities and bugs before the program compiles, hence the interest in the Rust programming language. In addition to that I would love to contribute to [projects](https://www.futo.org/about/what-does-futo-believe) that push back against the exploitative user data driven business model that too many big tech companies thrive off of nowadays. Additionally, I am very fascinated by rethinking the way computers work from the ground up. Particularly, to try to approach an architecture more similar to the human brain with Neuromorphic Computing. This website serves as a collection of personal projects, random posts, food recipes and my [CV](/cv).
