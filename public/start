# Max Gallup
I'm a computer science student interested in free and open source software, blockchain, WebAssembly, the Rust programming language, machine learning and operating systems.
I would love to contribute to [projects](https://www.futo.org/about/what-does-futo-believe) that push back against the user data driven business model that too many big tech companies thrive off of.
Additionally, eliminating security vulnerabilities through safer programming and increasing efforts to reduce the carbon footprint of computers is what I would like to work towards.
This website aims to serve as a collection of personal projects, posts and food recipes.
