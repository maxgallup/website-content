# Lessons learned from making a 2D Game with Rust and Bevy

On my journey of learning rust I decided to recreate a University assignment using Rust and the [Bevy game engine](bevyengine.org). Bevy uses an extremely well documented Entity Component System  which took some time to understand at first, but after messing around with some examples. It was very easy to start making my own game.

  

Initially I wanted to use SVG files for the character (for no good reason), but this ended up complicating things because I had to use an 3rd party plugin, since Bevy doesn't support SVG files natively. Since this plugin had its own issues I spent a lot of time trying to debug something until I noticed I could easily use PNG files for the character instead and went with that. **Lesson number 1** before you go down a deep rabbit hole because you think it's the best way, take a step back and at least try the other options you initially dismissed.
