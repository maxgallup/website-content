# A Philosophy of Software Design by John Ousterhout

If everyone writing software would follow basic principles outlines in this [book](https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/39996759-a-philosophy-of-software-design) the world would be a better place. I highly recommend this book to anyone working with code at every level. Thanks to [Ivano Malavolta](https://www.ivanomalavolta.com/) for introducing it to me in his Software Design course.
