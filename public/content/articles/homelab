# Homelab Self Hosting Setup

  

Do you also have an old PC or laptop lying around collecting dust? The main idea behind self-hosting is to setup hardware on your home network and connect it to the outside world to do useful things like:
* Store Files in the cloud like google drive
* Create cloud backups 
* Create a VPN to your home network
* Setup Docker/Portainer for management
* Host a simple website
* Host a VScode editor in the browser
* Create a test/sandbox environment for coding projects
* Automate scripts and tasks
* Network-wide add blocker

  

This post will showcase some of the previously mentioned points, however I greatly encourage you to think of some part of your digital life that can be self hosted.

  

### Nextcloud
A feature rich suite of services offered by Nextcloud allow you to fully replace google drive and dropbox. Nextcloud can be hosted on variety of platforms from Raspberry Pi to a fully dedicated home server. Installation can be ["dockerized"](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/source_installation.html)or just [installed natively](https://nextcloud.com/release-channels/) on a linux machine. Certain requirements must be met for native installation, so it's thus advised to follow an in-depth tutorial like the ones from [ApfelCast](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QB_FEWJ9BB4).
